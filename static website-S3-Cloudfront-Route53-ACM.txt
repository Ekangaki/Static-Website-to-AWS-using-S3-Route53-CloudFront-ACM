Here's a detailed, step-by-step guide to deploying a static website to AWS using S3, Route 53, CloudFront, and ACM:

Phase 1: S3 Setup (Storage)

1. Create an S3 Bucket:
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the S3 service.
- Click "Create bucket."
- Bucket name: Enter your domain name (e.g., www.yourdomain.com). This is crucial for Route 53 integration.
- AWS Region: Choose a region close to your target audience.
- Object Ownership: It is usually best to select ACLs disabled, and Object ownership set to Bucket owner enforced.
- Block Public Access settings for this bucket: Uncheck "Block all public access." Then acknowledge the warning message.
- Bucket Versioning: Leave disabled.
- Tags (Optional): Add tags for organization.
- Default encryption: Leave disabled.
- Click "Create bucket."
- Create a second bucket that is the root domain. (e.g. yourdomain.com).

2. Upload Website Files:
- Select your www.yourdomain.com bucket.
- Click "Upload" and upload your website's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static files.

3. Configure Static Website Hosting:
- Go to the "Properties" tab of your www.yourdomain.com bucket.
- Scroll down to "Static website hosting" and click "Edit."
- Select "Enable."
- Hosting type: "Host a static website."
- Index document: Enter index.html (or your main HTML file).
- Error document (optional): Enter error.html (or a custom error page).
- Click "Save changes."
- Repeat the static website hosting enablement for the root domain bucket.

4. Bucket Policy for Public Access:
- Go to the "Permissions" tab of your www.yourdomain.com bucket.
- Under "Bucket policy," click "Edit."
- Paste the following policy, replacing your-bucket-name with your actual bucket name:


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::www.yourdomain.com/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObjectRoot",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourdomain.com/*"
        }
    ]
}

- Click "Save changes."
- Repeat for the root domain bucket, changing the resource ARN accordingly.


Phase 2: Route 53 Setup (DNS)

1. Register a Domain Name (if you don't have one):
- In the Route 53 service, click "Registered domains."
- Click "Register domain" and follow the instructions.

2. Create a Hosted Zone:
- In the Route 53 service, click "Hosted zones."
- Click "Create hosted zone."
- Domain name: Enter your domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com).
- Type: "Public hosted zone."
- Click "Create hosted zone."

3. Create Alias Records:
- In your hosted zone, click "Create record."
- Create an "A" record for the root domain.
- Record name: Leave blank (for the root domain).
- Record type: "A - Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources."
- Alias: "Alias to S3 website endpoint"
- Region: Select the region of your S3 bucket.
- S3 website endpoint: select the correct S3 endpoint for the root domain bucket.
- Click "Create records"
- Create an "A" record for the www subdomain.
- Record name: www
- Record type: "A - Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources."
- Alias: "Alias to S3 website endpoint"
- - Region: Select the region of your S3 bucket.
- S3 website endpoint: select the correct S3 endpoint for the www domain bucket.
- Click "Create records"


Phase 3: ACM Setup (SSL/TLS Certificates)

1. Request a Certificate:
- Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.
- Click "Request a certificate."
- Request type: "Request a public certificate."
- Click "Next."
- Fully qualified domain name: Add yourdomain.com and www.yourdomain.com.
- Validation method: "DNS validation" (recommended).
- Click "Request."

2. DNS Validation:
- ACM will provide CNAME records.
- Go back to your Route 53 hosted zone.
- Create CNAME records for each domain name, using the values provided by ACM.
- Wait for the certificate status to change to "Issued" (this may take some time).


Phase 4: CloudFront Setup (CDN)

1. Create a CloudFront Distribution:
- Navigate to the CloudFront service.
- Click "Create distribution."
- Origin domain: select the www.yourdomain.com S3 static website endpoint. Do not select the bucket itself, select the website endpoint.
- Origin protocol policy: "HTTP Only."
- Viewer protocol policy: "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS."
- Alternate domain name (CNAME): Add www.yourdomain.com.
- Custom SSL certificate: select the ACM certificate you created.
- Default root object (optional): index.html.
- Click "Create distribution."
- Repeat the creation of a cloudfront distribution for the root domain using the root domain S3 static website endpoint, and root domain alternate CNAME.

2. Update Route 53 Alias Records:
- Go back to your Route 53 hosted zone.
- Edit the "A" records you created earlier.
- Change the "Alias target" to the CloudFront distribution domain name.
- Click "Save record."

Important Notes:

- DNS propagation may take some time.
- Ensure your S3 bucket policy is correctly configured.
- CloudFront distributions also take time to deploy.
- It is very important to use the S3 static website endpoint, and not the S3 bucket itself, when configuring cloudfront.
- Ensure that your domain names match exactly throughout the process.

This comprehensive guide should help you deploy your static website successfully.
